# Business-Analytics

Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using the skills you have acquired
in this course to complete an analytics project from data extraction to final predictive model.
This assignment can be completed individually, or in groups of two or three. Unlike your research
paper, there are parts of this assignment that you may not be able to complete until we have
covered the pertinent topics in class.

Premise
You are an analyst at an education non-profit. Your VP has an important meeting next
month with a large funding foundation and has asked you to do the following things to prepare:
1. Develop an online dashboard to track KPI’s and summary metrics for your constituent
base.
2. Build a model that predicts likely donors using the data in your database.

Assignment
You will be given access to a database containing the records of 2,000 individuals who are
either donors to your non-profit or are affiliated in some way. The database will be opened once
we’ve completed the SQL weeks as a class. To complete the project you will need to do the
following:
1. Look at the different attributes in the database and build a Tableau dashboard to track at
least 4 KPI’s. You are free to choose the KPI’s you track, but keep in mind that they should
be actionable (meaning your organization should be able to influence them – dollars
raised is a good example of this). Your dashboard should consist of a single tab and should
be formatted for printing on 8.5” x 11” paper.
2. Publish your dashboard to the Tableau server.
3. Build a dataset from the database of derived attributes that you can use to build a
statistical model. Examples of good attributes are, age, gender, dollars-raised, etc. Don’t
be afraid to create binary variables.
4. Using your derived attributes, build a logistical regression model in R to predict the
likelihood of an individual becoming a donor.
